In Brazil, most Physics seminars and colloquia are aimed at graduate students and professors. While this has clear reasons, it often makes it difficult for undergraduate students to share knowledge among their peers. In this context, the Dead Physicists Society was created in the [Institute of Physics at the University of São Paulo](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/) as a weekly undergraduate-level seminar for students to present and watch seminars on a wide range of topics related to Physics. The Society eventually grew and got to audiences beyond the city of São Paulo. Furthermore, it started organizing other events in addition to the original undergraduate seminars. 

While we try to keep most of our events in English, speakers are allowed to present seminars in Portuguese if they choose to do so. At the present semester (2021-1), our seminars are being held online on **specify dates**.
